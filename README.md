# Words of Wisdom (WoW)
<!--  Words of Wisdom (or WoW) will be a site where users can anonymously post life lessons, advice, as well as stories that taught them those lessons. Advice can be liked and commented on. Users can also choose to recieve a random piece of advice. -->

I created Words of Wisdom (WoW) once I started learning Ruby and how to use backend libraries. WoW uses these technologies to create an anonymous message board intended for users to post life lessons and advice. 

When users visit the page they are greeted with a message letting them know the intention of the website. The greeting message says:

**Words of Wisdom (or WoW) is a website intended to spread knowledge gained through life experience, fun facts, or whatever you would like! As long as it's kind, it is welcome.**

The navigation bar at the top of the page lets users know what pages the site has. They can post their own advice and decide what name they want the advice credited to, Browse all posted pieces of advice, or have the site display a piece of advice at random. 

###### Posting advice

When a user submits a piece of advice they will see a notification Thanking them by name and letting them know the site thinks their advice is very wise.

###### Browsing Advice

Users can see all advice posted in the "All Wisdom" page. They can even see their own if they posted one.

There is a space to display comments under each piece of advice. Users can comment on advice on the "Random Wisdom" page. Just maybe a user will generate the perfect piece of advice for their predicament!

The associated comments will appear underneath each piece of advice. Users can also delete comments associated with the advice that is generated. 

This project was made to practice creating and using a relational database and API using Ruby, Active Record, and Sinatra. The front end was made with React.
